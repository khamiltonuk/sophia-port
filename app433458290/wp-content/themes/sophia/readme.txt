Runo WordPress theme has been made especially for poets and writers. It is lightweight, clean, simple and spacious and feels like your favorite notebook. It has widget support (sidebar and three footer widget areas), styles for print and admin editor and advanced text editing tools. Add footnotes easily with [ref]shortcode[/ref]. When wanted, it preserves extra line breaks and spaces in your writing â€“ respects your poems, that is. Responsive layout looks good also in smaller screens. Supports 2-level menus (3rd level menus disabled). Only in Premium version: select your own background image or color; font options.
